# TelloObjectTracking
# This code is meant to allow a Tello Drone to maintain a visual contact with an object of a user-specified color.  ColorObjectTracking is the visual side of the code without
# any control of a drone so that it can be tested on a camera that does not fly around.  TelloObjectTracking combines this code with control over a drone.
